CHANGE LOG:
- ??:?? ?? EST, 2/??/2026
-- Initial Work
started conversion, i am writing this change log as i finished so i dont remember the time
i do know i converted tile, dust, collision, recipe, and item
then i did lighting, npc, and began player
then finished player, main and worldgen. and now we are here.
i did have the sounds & images in the project but ill likely have them loaded externally

-  8:17 PM EST, 2/16/2026
-- Finished Initial Source Conversion
finished converting all of the source files to GML, this will not run and is not intended to for now
most XNA classes will have to have to be reimplemented to work




TO DO:
- Xna classes
-- rectangle
-- vector
-- color

- Content
-- Images (using collage?)
-- Sounds (using audioExt?)

- Other stuff
-- im too lazy to put here




GENERAL NOTES:
i would add lua support because i can but apollo v3 doesnt work with the latest gm, i dont know why it just hard crashes
i had some other thihng i was gonna type but i forgot i shouldve just put that first instead of the lua support god damn it
nvm i rermember, im unsure if i wanna make a C# extension for base C# stuff like rand but ill probably just use another thing i have on another project
